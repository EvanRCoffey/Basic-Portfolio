	<h1>About Me</h1>
		<p>Welcome to my home page!  Here, you can learn more about me, view my programming portfolio, and find out how to get in touch.</p>
		<p>I'm currently finishing up my A.S. in Computer Science from Austin Community College to pair with my B.M.E. in Instrumental Music Education from The University of Southern Mississippi.  I'm also enrolled in the Coding Boot Camp at UT Austin, and I plan to soon begin a career as a web developer.  I live in Austin with my wife, Lesley, and our cat, Remy.</p>
